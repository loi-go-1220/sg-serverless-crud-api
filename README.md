# Book Library API

A simple CRUD REST API for managing books built with AWS Serverless technologies.

## Development Approach
This project follows an incremental development approach:
1. ‚úÖ Project setup
2. üîÑ Complete CREATE book endpoint implementation
3. ‚è≥ Add remaining CRUD endpoints incrementally

## Tech Stack
- AWS Lambda
- AWS API Gateway  
- AWS DynamoDB
- Serverless Framework v3
- TypeScript
- Node.js 22.17.1

## Current Status
- [x] Project initialization
- [x] Serverless Framework + TypeScript setup
- [x] CREATE book endpoint implementation
- [ ] Unit tests for CREATE endpoint
- [ ] GET books endpoints
- [ ] UPDATE book endpoint
- [ ] DELETE book endpoint
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Complete documentation

## API Endpoints (Planned)
```
POST   /books       - Create a new book
